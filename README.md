## Rust CEF bindings

Rust language bindings and minimal wrapper around the CEF C API. The goal of this library is to enable use of CEF without directly using unsafe or extern code and no more. It is very far away from achieving that goal, but it does make use of CEF possible and easier in simple cases.

### Repository Layout

`tools` contains the code generation tool, based heavily on and using the `cef_parser.py` and related CEF tooling. It generates Rust wrapper code from the output of the CEF C++ parser, similar to the `make_capi_header.py` tool in the CEF repository. It has also been extended to parse basic `struct` and `enum` definitions in `include/internal/cef_types.h`.

`cef-sys` is a `rust-bindgen`-generated crate. It is pretty minimal templated code from the basic recommended `bindgen` structure. It invokes `tools/make_rust_wrapper.py` to generate a list of header files to feed to `bindgen`.

`cef` contains the Rust wrappers. The base CEF wrappers are implemented here, such as refcounting and string types, and the auto-generated wrappers are generated and included from the build script by invoking `tools/make_rust_wrapper.py`.

`cef-test` contains a sample of how the `cef` crate can be used.

### Build Instructions

- Download a minimal or standard binary distribuion from the [CEF build site](http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/index.html)
- Unpack the archive
- Set the `CEF_ROOT` environment variable to the resulting directory
- Create a temporary directory in the crate you are trying to run (eg `cef-test/release`)
- Copy the contents of `$CEF_ROOT/Release` and `$CEF_ROOT/Resources` into the temporary directory
- From within the build directory, run `cargo run`. If you get a cargo error that says "(never executed)", do `cargo run` from the crate root once first (it should crash) before running it from within the temporary directory.

`windows64` is the only target this has been tested on.
